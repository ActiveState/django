:meth:`.QuerySet.annotate`, :meth:`~.QuerySet.aggregate`, and
:meth:`~.QuerySet.extra` methods were subject to SQL injection in column
aliases, using a suitably crafted dictionary, with dictionary expansion, as the
``**kwargs`` passed to these methods.

Passing certain inputs to multipart forms could result in an infinite loop when
parsing files.
