Django 1.11.29.2 compatibility fix

Skip non-ASCII test on Windows
================================================================

The non-ASCII test uses a unicode filename, and causes standard
windows file operations to fail.  Therefore the file is renamed
to x.txt, and renamed to unicode on a non-windows system at
test time.
