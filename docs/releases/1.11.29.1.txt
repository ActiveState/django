Django 1.11.29.1 security fixes

CVE-2021-33203: Potential directory traversal via ``admindocs``
===============================================================

Staff members could use the :mod:`~django.contrib.admindocs`
``TemplateDetailView`` view to check the existence of arbitrary files.
Additionally, if (and only if) the default admindocs templates have been
customized by the developers to also expose the file contents, then not only
the existence but also the file contents would have been exposed.

As a mitigation, path sanitation is now applied and only files within the
template root directories can be loaded.
